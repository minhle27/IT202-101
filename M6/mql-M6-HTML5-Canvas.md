<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>This function implements what happens when the ball touches the obstacle. The logic<br>for checking if the ball lies within the range of the obstacle is<br>similar to that of the paddle. However, the logic for determining if the<br>ball actually makes contact with the obstacle is more physically complex than that<br>of the paddle. Using the paddle approach would simply cause the ball to<br>fall through the obstacle. Therefore, I establish both a lower and upper bound<br>for detecting a collision instead of relying on a single bound as in<br>the paddle approach.<br></p>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this assignment and the related HTML5 Canvas readings (at least a few sentences for full credit)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In this assignment, I have learned how to utilize the HTML5 canvas element.<br>It turns out that there are numerous fascinating possibilities with this element, such<br>as creating games like the one in this assignment or drawing various figures<br>that pique my interest. Throughout this specific game, I have gained an understanding<br>of the essential logic components necessary for building a game, such as the<br>game loop and drawing objects. Additionally, I have learned how to structure code<br>effectively to manage complexity as the source code expands. In this pong game,<br>I have delved into programming the &quot;physics&quot; aspect, which proved to be challenging<br>yet highly intriguing. Overall, this has been a truly exceptional learning experience. Thank<br>you, professor.<br></p><br></td></tr>
